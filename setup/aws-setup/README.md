# AWS Deep Learning Desktop with NICE DCV

This project is a tutorial on how to launch an AWS deep learning desktop with [NICE DCV](https://aws.amazon.com/hpc/dcv/) for developing, training, testing, and visualizing deep learning models. To launch the deep learning desktop, you have a choice of two [Ubuntu Pro AMIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIs.html):

* [Ubuntu Pro 22.04 LTS](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-uy7jg4dds3qjw) (Default)
* [Ubuntu Pro 20.04 LTS](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-zvdilnwnuopoo)
* [AWS Deep Learning AMI (Ubuntu 18.04), version 50.0](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/amis/) (Deprecated)


Using either Ubuntu Pro AMI above, you can launch a deep learning desktop pre-configured with [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit), [cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn), [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [Apache MxNet](https://aws.amazon.com/mxnet/) deep-learning frameworks. 

## Step by Step Tutorial

### <a name="Prerequisites"></a> Prerequisites
This tutorial assumes you have an [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/account/), and you have [Administrator job function](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_job-functions.html) access to the AWS Management Console.

To get started:

* Select your [AWS Region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html). The AWS Regions supported by this project include, us-east-1, us-east-2, us-west-2, eu-west-1, eu-central-1, ap-southeast-1, ap-southeast-2, ap-northeast-1, ap-northeast-2, and ap-south-1. Note that not all Amazon EC2 instance types are available in all [AWS Availability Zones](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html) in an AWS Region.
* Subscribe to the [Ubuntu Pro 22.04 LTS](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-uy7jg4dds3qjw) or the [Ubuntu Pro 20.04 LTS](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-zvdilnwnuopoo) AMI 
* If you do not already have an Amazon EC2 key pair, [create a new Amazon EC2 key pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#prepare-key-pair). You will need the key pair name to specify the ```KeyName``` parameter when creating the CloudFormation stack below.
* You will need an [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) bucket. If you don't have one, [create a new Amazon S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/create-bucket-overview.html) in the AWS region you selected. The S3 bucket can be empty at this point.
* Use [AWS check ip](http://checkip.amazonaws.com/) to get your public IP address. This will be the IP address you will need to specify ```DesktopAccessCIDR``` parameter in the stack. 
* Clone this Git repository on your laptop using [```git clone ```](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository).

### Create AWS CloudFormation Stack
Use the AWS CloudFormation template [deep-learning-ubuntu-desktop.yaml](deep-learning-ubuntu-desktop.yaml) from your cloned  repository to create a new CloudFormation stack using the [ AWS Management console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-create-stack.html), or using the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/create-stack.html). See [Reference](#Reference) section for the [template](deep-learning-ubuntu-desktop.yaml) input parameters, and stack outputs.

The template [deep-learning-ubuntu-desktop.yaml](deep-learning-ubuntu-desktop.yaml) creates [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) resources. If you are creating CloudFormation Stack using the console, in the review step, you must check 
**I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources.** If you use the ```aws cloudformation create-stack``` CLI, you must use ```--capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM```. 

### Connect to Desktop using SSH

* Once the stack status in CloudFormation console is ```CREATE_COMPLETE```, find the deep learning desktop instance launched in your stack in the Amazon EC2 console, and [connect to the instance using SSH](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html) as user ```ubuntu```, using your SSH key pair.
* When you connect using SSH, and you see the message ```"Cloud init in progress. Machine will REBOOT after cloud init is complete!!"```, disconnect and try later after about 15 minutes. The desktop installs the NICE DCV server on first-time startup, and reboots after the install is complete.
* If you see the message ```NICE DCV server is enabled!```, run the command ```sudo passwd ubuntu``` to set a new password for user ```ubuntu```. Now you are ready to connect to the desktop using the [NICE DCV client](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dcv/latest/userguide/client.html)

### Connect to Desktop using NICE DCV Client
* Download and install the [NICE DCV client](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dcv/latest/userguide/client.html) on your laptop.
* Use the NICE DCV Client to login to the desktop as user ```ubuntu```
* When you first login to the desktop using the NICE DCV client, you will be asked if you would like to upgrade the OS version. **Do not upgrade the OS version** .

## Developing in an IDE
Use the Ubuntu ```Software``` desktop application to install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or your favorite IDE to build, debug, and train deep learning models. Open a desktop terminal, and run ```conda env list``` to view the available Conda environments. 

## Working with Data

The deep learning desktop instance has access to the S3 bucket you specified when you create the CloudFormation stack. You can verify the access to your S3 bucket by running the command ```aws s3 ls your-bucket-name```. If you do not have access to the S3 bucket, you will see an error message. If your S3 bucket is empty, the previous command will produce no output, which is normal. 

There is an [Amazon EBS](https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/) root volume attached to the instance. In addition, an [Amazon EFS](https://aws.amazon.com/efs/) file-system is mounted on your desktop at ```EFSMountPath```, which by default is ```/home/ubuntu/efs```. Optionally, an [Amazon FSx for Lustre](https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/) file-system can be mounted on your desktop at ```FSxMountPath```, which by default is ```/home/ubuntu/fsx```.  See ```FSxForLustre``` parameter in [Reference](#Reference) section to learn how to enable FSx for Lustre file-system.

The Amazon EBS volume attached to the instance is deleted when the deep learning instance is terminated. However, the EFS file-system persists after you terminate the desktop instance. 

## Using Amazon SageMaker from deep learning desktop
The deep learning desktop is pre-configured to use [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) machine learning platform. To get started with [Amazon SageMaker examples](https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples) in a [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html) notebook, execute following steps in a desktop terminal:

	mkdir ~/git
	cd ~/git
	git clone https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples.git
	jupyter-lab
	
This will start a ```jupyter-lab``` notebook server in the terminal, and open a tab in your web browser. You can now explore the Amazon SageMaker examples. 

For SageMaker examples that require you to specify a [subnet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Subnets.html#vpc-subnet-basics), and a [security group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html), use the pre-configured environment variables  ```desktop_subnet_id``` and ```desktop_sg_id```, respectively. If FSx for Lustre is enabled, pre-configured environment variable  ```fsx_fs_id``` contains FSx for Lustre file-system id, and ```fsx_mount_name``` variable contains the mount name.

## Stopping and Restarting the Desktop

You may safely reboot, stop, and restart the desktop instance at any time. The desktop will automatically mount the EFS file-system at restart. If FSx for Luster file-system is enabled, it is automtically mounted, as well.

## Deleting the Stack

When you no longer need the desktop instance, you may delete the AWS CloudFormation stack from the AWS CloudFormation console. Deleting the stack will terminate the desktop instance, and delete the root EBS volume attached to the desktop. If the FSx for Lustre file-system is enabled, it is automatically deleted when you delete the stack.

The EFS file system is **not** automatically deleted when you delete the stack.
